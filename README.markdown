# Intervention #

A PHP "framework" for use with inherited, and poorly implemented, websites.

What, you mean you've never had one of those projects?  Then you are lucky.

Intervention makes these situations manageable by using a simple MVC-ish, pseudo-OO procedural.

## Installation ##

Grab the latest release from:

    http://github.com/n3bulous/intervention/downloads

and extract within the project.  "Within" is a relative term.

    cd /path/to/website/root
    tar -xjf /path/to/tarball

## Commentary ##

IMNSHO, PHP has become too much like Java.  I want to type less, not more!  This project hopes to be a lightweight merger of OO and procedural development practices.

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests ##

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I donâ€™t break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself in another branch so I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
